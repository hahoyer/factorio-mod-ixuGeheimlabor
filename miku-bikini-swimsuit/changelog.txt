Version: 3.0.1
Date: 2022-04-02

  Changes:
    - Added changelog (this file).
    - Added switch to toggle debugging even (see common.lua).
    - Respect changes that other mods have made to the default character (single character: only overwrite properties that are absolutely necessary to the workings of this mod, e.g. character corpse and graphics; multiple characters: propagate changes that don't interfere with this mod from the default to the new character). This is re-using code first used in version 1.1.4 of "I, Robot".

  Bugfixes:
    - Changed name of a global variable that is also used by "Gear Girl Character", in order to avoid that variables of the other mod are overwritten.

Version: 3.0.0
